Some fun questions from CS50 and other places.<br>
Some random projects created by me and my friends for making some actual games. <br>
<b>Just for leisure purpose. So I can work on this while my GF watching K drama.<b><br>

BTW tortiseGit is actually kinda buggy recently.I still enjoy Git Bash more than others.
